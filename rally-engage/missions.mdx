### **Missions**

Missions are single-player activities designed to encourage members to build healthy habits of a choice. Approximately 105 unique missions are available for members to participate in.

---

#### **Mission Structure**

- **Core Pattern**: Every mission follows a similar structure with three types of targets:

  1. **Daily Target**: A specific goal to achieve in a single day (e.g., walk 10,000 steps or check in once for eating healthy).
  2. **Weekly Target**: A goal to meet the daily target a set number of days within a fixed week (Sunday to Saturday).
  3. **Overall Mission Target**: Completing four weeks of the defined activity, where each week requires meeting the weekly target.

- **Week Definition**: A week is always a fixed Sunday-to-Saturday cycle, regardless of when a member joins a mission.
- **Flexibility**: The four weeks do not need to be consecutive; members can miss weeks and still complete the mission by achieving four successful weeks over time.

#### **Examples of Missions**

1. **Progress-Based Mission Example**:
   - **Mission**: Walk 10,000 steps a day for 3 days a week for 4 weeks.
     1. **Daily Target**: Walk 10,000 steps in a single day.
     2. **Weekly Target**: Achieve the daily target on any 3 days within a Sunday-to-Saturday week.
     3. **Overall Target**: Complete 4 weeks where the weekly target is met.
2. **Check-In-Based Mission Example**:
   - **Mission**: Eat healthy food, check in 5 times a week for 4 weeks.
   - **Daily Target**: Check in once per day to confirm the activity (e.g., eating healthy food), with a behind-the-scenes value of "1" per check-in.
   - **Weekly Target**: Check in 5 times within a Sunday-to-Saturday week.
   - **Overall Target**: Complete 4 weeks where the weekly target is met.

#### **Types of Missions**

1. **Progress-Based Missions**:
   - Require members to input specific progress data (e.g., number of steps walked, glasses of water consumed, swimming distance).
   - **Fitness Tracker Integration**: Some progress-based missions (e.g., walking, swimming) can be powered by fitness trackers (e.g., Garmin, Fitbit), automatically contributing data to the mission. Others (e.g., glasses of water) require manual input as they are not yet tracker-supported.
2. **Check-In-Based Missions**:
   - Require members to simply check in to confirm theyâ€™ve completed the activity for the day (e.g., eating healthy food).
   - No quantitative input is needed beyond the check-in action.

---

#### **Points and Rewards**

- Members earn points at multiple levels:
  - **Daily Achievement**: Points for meeting the daily target.
  - **Weekly Achievement**: Points for meeting the weekly target.
  - **Mission Completion**: Points for completing the overall mission (four weeks).
- Points incentivize consistent participation and completion.

#### **Mission Participation**

- **Joining a Mission**:
  - Members can join a mission at any time; there is no defined start or end date.
  - The weekly cycle begins on Sunday and ends on Saturday, regardless of the join date.
  - Example: Joining on a Friday may make it difficult to meet a weekly target requiring more than 2-3 days in the first week, pushing completion to the next week.
- **Repeating Missions**: After completing a mission, members can restart it from zero if desired.
- **Quitting a Mission**: Members can quit midway, but if they rejoin later, their progress resets to week zero/week one.
- **Home Screen Display**:

  - All active missions a member is participating in are displayed prominently on the home screen.
  - This serves as the primary reason for members to return daily, allowing quick check-ins or progress updates.

- **Post-Completion Display**:
  - Completed missions remain on the home screen (not automatically dismissed).
  - Reason: Some missions (e.g., tracker-based) may complete in the background, and members can view stats upon returning.
  - Members can manually dismiss completed missions from the home screen if desired.

---

#### **Clinical Missions**

- **Definition**: A subset of missions designated as "clinical missions" with special requirements.
- **Access Restrictions**:
  - Hidden from dependents (users under 18 years old).
  - Available only to non-dependents (users 18 and older).
- **HIPAA Compliance**:
  - First-time participants must accept a HIPAA authorization (or equivalent legal requirement) before joining a clinical mission.
  - From the second time onward, no additional authorization is required, and members can join directly.

---

#### **Weekly Cycle Rationale**

- **Fixed Sunday-to-Saturday Cycle**:
  - Applies to all missions, regardless of join date, for consistency in tracking.
  - Trade-off: Simplifies tracking across multiple missions, avoiding confusion from variable cycles (e.g., Monday-Sunday for one mission, Thursday-Wednesday for another).
- **Example Challenge**:
  - Joining two missions on Monday and three on Thursday with different cycles would be hard to track.
  - Fixed cycles ensure members can easily remember and meet weekly targets.

#### **Key Features and Flexibility**

- **No Fixed Timeline**: Members can finish missions at their own pace, with no start or end date constraints.
- **Manual vs. Automated Input**:
  - Manual input required for non-tracker-supported missions (e.g., glasses of water).
  - Automated input via fitness trackers for supported missions (e.g., walking, swimming).
- **User Control**: Options to quit, restart, or dismiss missions provide flexibility tailored to individual preferences.
- **Steps manual entry:** Steps that are entered manually apply at the user level, meaning if the user is in multiple missions or challenges they only manually need to enter steps once to apply to each mission or challenge they are entered in
