### **Gift Cards**

Gift Cards are an employer reward mechanism where members redeem Gift Card Credit (equivalent to dollars) for gift cards from various brands. This feature is distinct from Rally Points-based redemptions like Offers and Donations.

#### **How It Works**

- **Purpose**: Employers reward members with Gift Card Credit, which can be used to purchase gift cards.
- **Availability**:
  - Over 200 active brands are available (e.g., popular retailers, dining options).
  - Different brands support different denominations (e.g., $10, $25, $50).
- **Redemption Process**:
  - Members view the full list of brands in the Rewards tab.
  - Clicking a brand reveals available denominations.
  - Members select and redeem a denomination using their Gift Card Credit.

#### **In-App Experience**

- **Location**: Gift card options are displayed in the Rewards tab.
- **Tracking**:
  - Redeemed gift cards appear in the “My Redeemed Rewards” section under “My Gift Cards.”
  - Includes gift cards won through sweeps and auctions, if applicable.

**Feature Flagging**: Gift Cards can be enabled or disabled at an affiliation level based on client configuration.
