### **Challenges**

Challenges are group-based activities with a fixed start date and end date, designed to encourage participants to achieve a specific target over the challenge period. For example, a challenge might require participants to "complete 20 miles of walking in five days." Challenges focus on individual participation (though team challenges are mentioned as covered in a separate document) and can be configured as either public or private.

---

**Key Characteristics**:

- Fixed start and end dates.
- Overall target (e.g., 20 miles in 5 days) rather than daily goals.
- Progress is tracked over the entire challenge period.
- Checkpoints allow participants to earn points for meeting milestones, but there are no daily requirements.

#### **Supported Activities**

Challenges are based on activities that typically require user input or integration with a tracker. Examples include:

- Number of steps logged.
- Number of miles logged (e.g., walking, swimming).
- Number of glasses of water consumed.
- Minutes of exercise completed.
- Other activities beyond simple check-ins.

#### **Types of Challenges**

1. **Individual Challenges** (Primary focus of this guide):

   - Participants work toward a personal goal.
   - Can be either public or private (details below).

2. **Team Challenges**:
   - Covered in a separate document; not detailed here.

### **Individual Challenges: Public vs. Private**

#### **Public Challenges**

- **Definition**: Defined at the product level and available globally to all users.
- **Lifecycle**: Operate on a product-defined schedule with no client-specific customizations.
- **Templates**: Use a fixed set of templates that rotate throughout the year.
- **Accessibility**: Open to everyone; no restrictions on participation.
- **Checkpoints**: Feature a fixed number of predefined checkpoints (e.g., 5, 10, 15 miles in a 20-mile challenge). Participants earn "rally points" for meeting checkpoints and additional points for completing the challenge.

#### **Private Challenges**

- **Definition**: Configurable by clients with customizable settings.
- **Configuration Options**:
  - **Start Date and End Date**: Chosen by the client.
  - **Activity**: Specific activity type (e.g., walking, swimming).
  - **Target**: Goal to achieve (e.g., 20 miles).
  - **Listing Date**: When the challenge appears for members to join.
  - **Last Join Date**: Optional deadline after which members cannot join (if not defined, members can join until the end date).
  - **Visibility**: Can be marked as hidden in the UI.
  - **Affiliation Restrictions**: Can be limited to a subset of affiliations within one organization (e.g., only affiliations 3 and 4).
- **Joining Rules**:
  - If a member joins a challenge before its start date, a countdown timer (e.g., "Challenge starts in XYZ days") is displayed.
  - If no last join date is set, members can join up to the end date (including the last day).
  - If a last join date is defined, the challenge disappears from the UI after that date.
- **Visibility and Access**:
  - **Not Hidden**: Visible to all members of the defined affiliations (or the entire organization if no subset is specified) on the explore page in the UI.
  - **Hidden**: Only discoverable via an invite code or link shared by the client or through a marketing campaign.
  - **Affiliation \+ Hidden**: If hidden and restricted to a subset of affiliations, only members in those affiliations can join, even with the invite code.
  - **No Granular Restrictions**: Cannot restrict within an affiliation (e.g., only members over 50 in affiliation 3). Anyone in the specified affiliation can join if they have access to the invite code/link.
- **Invite Code/Link Sharing**:
  - Clients can send invite codes themselves or through marketing campaigns.
  - If shared beyond the intended audience within the affiliation, anyone in that affiliation can join (no further slicing possible).

### **Challenge Participation and Progress**

- **Check-Ins**: Once the challenge starts, members can check in to log progress (e.g., miles walked, steps taken).
- **Progress Tracking**: Progress accrues as check-ins are recorded.
- **Checkpoints (Public Challenges)**:
  - Fixed milestones (e.g., 5, 10, 15 miles in a 20-mile challenge).
  - Participants earn "rally points" at each checkpoint and additional points upon completion.
- **Homepage Visibility**: Active challenges (including upcoming ones not yet started) members are participating in appear on the homepage for easy access and check-ins.

### **Leaderboard**

- **Overview**: Each active challenge includes a leaderboard accessible on the challenge page.
- **Features**:
  - Displays the participantâ€™s rank and progress relative to others.
  - Shows a "podium" with the top 3 participants (avatar, screen name, total progress).
- **Scope**: Global for public challenges; participants across different clients can see each other.
- **Refresh Rate**: Updates on a 24-hour cycle at 12 noon CT each day
- **Privacy**:
  - No opt-out option; all participants appear on the leaderboard.
  - Pseudonymous screen names and non-real avatars help protect privacy.
- **Rewards**: No additional rewards for leaderboard position (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd receive the same points as others who meet the target).

---

### **Rewards**

- **Client Configurability**: Clients can define rewards for challenge completion.
- **Reward Options**:
  - **Specific Instance**: Reward a single challenge (public or private).
  - **Challenge Type**: Reward completion of a specific type (e.g., "SF Stomp" anytime during the year).
  - **Reward based on broad categories**:
    - Any public challenge.
    - Any walking challenge.
    - Any non-walking challenge.
    - Any individual or team challenge.
  - **Combinations**: Flexible combinations of the above are possible.
- **Common Practices**:
  - Rewarding private challenges.
  - Blanket rewards like "complete any public challenge" or "complete any walking challenge."

### **Additional Notes**

- **Org Restrictions**: Private challenges are limited to one organization and cannot span multiple organizations.
- **UI Behavior**:
  - Hidden challenges require an invite code/link for discovery.
  - Non-hidden private challenges appear on the explore page for eligible members.
- **Limitations**:
  - No way to restrict participation within an affiliation beyond affiliation-level settings (e.g., age-based targeting is not possible within the system).
  - Leaderboard participation is mandatory with no opt-out.
