### **Donations**

Donations allow members to contribute their Rally Points to charitable causes, providing another redemption avenue within the Rally Rewards mechanism. This feature fosters engagement by connecting points to real-world impact, with donations processed quarterly.

#### **How It Works**

- **Purpose**: Members donate Rally Points to support charities, with no upper or lower limit on contributions.
- **Availability**:
  - Target: Maintain 2–4 donation options per quarter.
  - Current Status: No active donations are listed as of now; the Q1 list is pending as of Mar 2025\.
- **Transparency**:
  - Members see the total Rally Points donated to each cause (aggregate across all members, no individual breakdown).
  - Donation details (e.g., target Rally Points and corresponding dollar amount donated if the target is met) are listed on each donation’s detailed page.
- **Processing**:
  - Each quarter, Optum evaluates total Rally Points donated to a charity.
  - If the target threshold is met, Optum donates the specified dollar amount to the charity.

#### **In-App Experience**

- **Location**: Donation options appear in the Rewards tab.
- **Tracking**: Previous donations are listed in the “My Redeemed Rewards” section under “My Donations.”

#### **Additional Features**

- **Feature Flagging**: Donations can be enabled or disabled at an affiliation level based on client configuration.
- **Private Donations**:
  - Clients can opt to display private donations visible only to members of specific affiliations.
  - Current Status: No private donations are configured as of Mar 2025, per client requirements.
