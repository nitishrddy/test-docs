#### **Benefits Cards**

Within the Benefits tab, the Benefits Cards section showcases programs and content members are eligible for, drawing from two primary sources:

- **PBW Per Eligible Programs API**: This pulls in all programs a member qualifies for through PBW, provided the content is mapped in the system (managed by Optum Product via the Capillary sheet). For example, if a member is eligible for "Program A" (e.g., a diabetes management course), but no content mapping exists, it won’t appear. However, if mapped, it displays as a card with standard title, description, and imagery.
- **Client-Customized Content**: Clients can override standard content for PBW programs or add entirely custom programs. For instance, if "Program A" has generic content like "Manage your health with this course," a client might customize it to "Join our tailored diabetes support program—exclusive to \[Company Name\] members," uploading a unique image and linking to a custom landing page. Alternatively, a client could create a fully custom program, such as "Mental Health Day Off," available only to their affiliation, without deeper eligibility checks beyond affiliation.

Benefits Cards support all CTA types, mirroring the flexibility of rewardable activities and spotlight campaigns. For example, a card for a "Fitness Reimbursement Program" might link internally to the Rewards tab for claiming points or externally to a gym partner’s sign-up page.

#### **Resource Links**

The Resource Links section appears in the right sidebar of the Benefits tab on the website or at the bottom of the tab in the mobile app. It offers a structured way to provide quick access to external resources, configurable at the affiliation level. Clients can define up to three categories, each containing up to ten links. For example:

- **Category: Wellness Resources**
  - "Mental Health Hotline" (links to [www.example.com/support](http://www.example.com/support))
  - "Nutrition Guide PDF" (links to an external file)
- **Category: HR Support**
  - "Benefits Enrollment" (links to [www.companyhr.com/enroll](http://www.companyhr.com/enroll))
- **Category: Learning**
  - "Leadership Training" (links to [www.trainingplatform.com](http://www.trainingplatform.com))

Currently, Resource Links supports only external hyperlinks, with clients defining the display text and URL for each. A roadmap item slated for March / April 2025 will expand this to include SSO links.
