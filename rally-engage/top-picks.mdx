#### **Top Picks**

Located at the bottom of the homepage dashboard, the Top Picks section serves as a dynamic hub for personalized and client-driven content. It draws from three distinct sources to surface relevant recommendations and information:

- **PBW Recommendations**: Powered by the PBW Offers API, this includes offers and programs a member is eligible for, provided there’s a content mapping in the system. For instance, if a member qualifies for a "Stress Management Workshop" via PBW, and the mapping exists, it appears in Top Picks.
- **Internal Rally Rules**: Rally’s proprietary logic generates recommendations based on member data, such as past activity or profile attributes. For example, if a member frequently engages with fitness challenges, Rally might recommend a new "10K Steps Challenge."
- **Client-Specific Top Picks**: Clients can manually add content they want their members to see, tailored by affiliation. For instance, a company might promote an internal "Employee Appreciation Event" exclusively for its staff.

Targeting in Top Picks by clients is primarily affiliation-based, though the system has the capability for deeper segmentation using profile attributes (similar to slicing rules). As of now, this deeper targeting is a future consideration, with current efforts focused on affiliation-level customization to maintain parity with Rally 1.0. For example, a client might configure a Top Pick to show a "New Hire Orientation Program" only to employees in Affiliation 2\.

Additionally, the Top Picks section integrates approximately 110 recommendation rules powered by e-visor, biometric screening results, and health survey responses. These rules suggest missions or programs tailored to the member’s profile. For instance, if a member’s health survey indicates high stress levels, Top Picks can recommend a "Mindfulness Meditation Program."
