### **Max Cap**

Max Cap establishes the maximum rewards a member can earn from a program, with options for primary and bonus caps, influencing how rewards are distributed.

#### **How They Work**

- **Customizable Limits**: When a client sets up their rewards program, they define a max cap. For percentage-based rewards (e.g., Premium Reduction %), the default cap is 100%, meaning members can earn up to 100% of their eligible reward. For other currencies like dollars, Employer Credits, or Employer Points, clients specify the cap (e.g., $300 or 5 credits). Once a member reaches this cap across all eligible activities, they can’t earn more from the program.
- **Partial Rewards for Cap Limits**: If a member’s next activity would exceed the max cap, they receive only a partial reward to stay within the limit. For instance, if the cap is $300 and a member has earned $250, completing a $100 activity doesn’t give them the full $100 (which would total $350). Instead, they earn $50, hitting the $300 cap exactly. Any excess potential reward is forfeited.
- **Bonus Activities Exception**: Activities marked as “bonus” don’t count toward the primary max cap. Members can earn these rewards on top of the cap, and clients can define a separate bonus max cap if they offer multiple bonus activities. For example, with a $300 primary cap and a $100 bonus cap, a member could earn $400 total if they complete both standard and bonus activities.
- **Dual Max Caps Capability**: The system supports two caps: a primary max cap for standard activities and a bonus max cap for bonus activities. This allows clients to incentivize extra engagement without inflating the primary budget. For instance, a client might set a $300 primary cap and a $100 bonus cap, letting members earn $300 from regular tasks like flu shots and an extra $100 from bonus activities.
- **Currency Limitation**: A restriction exists where clients can’t offer two percentage-based rewards simultaneously. For example, a client can’t set a primary reward as 50% premium reduction and a bonus reward as 50% deductible credit. The system supports only one percentage-based reward type at a time, though other currencies (e.g., dollars and points) can co-exist.

#### **Example**

Consider a client with a $300 primary max cap and a $100 bonus max cap, using dollars. A member earns $250 from standard activities (e.g., $100 for a physical, $150 for a health survey). They then complete a $100 standard activity. Since earning the full $100 would push them to $350 (exceeding $300), they receive only $50, reaching the $300 cap. Later, they complete a $75 bonus activity (e.g., a public challenge). This doesn’t affect the primary cap, so they earn the full $75, totaling $375 ($300 primary \+ $75 bonus). If they do another $50 bonus activity, they’d get $25 more, hitting the $100 bonus cap, for a grand total of $400.
