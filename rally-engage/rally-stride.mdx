### **Rally Stride**

Rally Stride is a rewardable walking activity designed to encourage physical activity among members. Clients can opt to include Rally Stride in their rewards program, making it available only to their specific member population. If not enabled by the client, Rally Stride remains inaccessible to members. This feature allows clients to incentivize walking by setting customizable reward targets and offering flexibility in how members earn rewards.

#### **Key Functionality**

- **Availability**: Rally Stride is an optional activity that clients can enable for their members. It appears on the member’s home screen and rewardable activity section only if activated by the client.

- **Goal Setting**:
  - Upon enrolling in Rally Stride for the first time, members select a daily step goal from five predefined levels: 5,000, 7,500, 10,000, 11,250, or 12,500 steps.
  - Each day a member meets their chosen step goal counts toward their monthly target.
- **Monthly Target**:
  - The default target is meeting the daily step goal on 12 unique days per month.
  - Clients can adjust this target (e.g., 5, 6, 8, 15 days) based on their program needs.
- **Reward Options**:

  - Clients define the reward type: employer points, credits, dollars (via HSA, client reward, or gift card).
  - Earnings can count toward a member’s “boulders” or primary max cap, configurable by the client.

- **Program Duration**: Clients can run Rally Stride year-round (12 cycles) or limit it to a reduced number of cycles (e.g., 10 months).

- **Physical Activity Exemption**:
  - Members unable to participate in physical activities can request an exemption via the in-app Settings page with a simple attestation.
  - If enabled by the client as per the CRD, an alternative activity (Complete any 3 missions per month) becomes available, offering the same reward as Rally Stride.
  - Members with an exemption remain eligible for Rally Stride but can only earn from one activity (Stride or the alternative) per month, whichever is completed first.

#### **Client Configuration Options**

- **Reward Customization**: Set the reward type and value for meeting the monthly target.
- **Target Adjustment**: Modify the default target of 12 days to a custom number (e.g., 5–15 days).
- **Cycle Duration**: Configure the program to run for 12 months or fewer (e.g., 10 months).
- **Alternative Activity**: Opt to offer an alternative activity for members with physical limitations, with the default being “complete any 3 missions.”

#### **Member Experience**

- **Enrollment**: Members enroll in Rally Stride via the app or website from the Rewardable Activities section. They have to select a daily step goal from the 5 levels available.
- **Tracking Progress**:
  - A Rally Stride card appears on the home screen, displaying progress toward the monthly target (e.g., “3/12 days met”).
  - Progress updates each time the daily step goal is achieved.
  - Progress is tracked only through a connected fitness tracker and members cannot manually check in.
- **Goal Changes**:
  - Currently, members cannot change their step goal mid-month (as of February 27, 2025).
  - A planned update will allow goal changes at any time, effective immediately, with prior progress retained (e.g., 3 days at 10,000 steps \+ 1 day at 5,000 steps \= 4/12 days).
- **Earning Rewards**: Members earn the configured reward upon meeting the monthly target.
- **Alternative Option**: If physical activity exemption is availed and an alternative is available, members see it in the rewardable activity section and can complete it instead of Rally Stride (but earn from only one per month).
