### **DIscount Offers**

Offers are a redemption option for Rally Points, earned by members through completing various activities in the app. This feature allows members to use Rally Points to purchase offers from various merchants, enhancing the perceived value of Rally Points. Offers are currently tied to the Rally Rewards mechanism and are distinct from employer-based rewards like Gift Card Credit.

#### **How It Works**

- **Purpose**: Members redeem Rally Points for offers at merchants such as Target, Walmart, Best Buy, Allbirds, and more.
- **Offer Characteristics**:
  - Offers available on Rally Engage are typically better than publicly available deals.
  - They are priced at an affordable Rally Points rate.
  - Example: A member might redeem 600 Rally Points for a 20% discount on any shoes at Allbirds (note: this is an illustrative example, not a confirmed offer).
- **Dynamic Nature**:
  - Offers are fast-moving and expire over time.
  - Expired offers are replaced with new ones to maintain variety.
  - Approximately 60 offers are targeted to be live available at any time

#### **In-App Experience**

- **Location**: Offers are displayed in the Rewards tab under the “Offers” section.
- **Navigation**:
  - Tapping “View All” shows a list of offers organized by categories (e.g., retail, electronics).
  - Tapping “View All” within a category reveals more offers specific to that category.
- **Redemption Tracking**: Redeemed offers appear in the “My Redeemed Rewards” section under “My Offers.”

#### **Offer Types**

1. **Link-Based Offers**:
   - The redemption provides a link in the “My Redeemed Rewards” section.
   - Clicking the link directs the member to the partner website with the offer automatically applied.
2. **Common Coupon Code Offers**:
   - A single coupon code is provided to all members who redeem the offer.
   - Visible in “My Redeemed Rewards” under “My Offers.”
   - Reusable across members, though there may be a total usage limit (e.g., if shared, others could potentially use it until the limit is reached).
3. **Unique Coupon Code Offers**:
   - Each member receives a one-time-use coupon code, distinct from other members’ codes.
   - Visible in “My Redeemed Rewards” under “My Offers.”
   - Not reusable or shareable due to its unique nature.

**Feature Flagging**: Offers can be enabled or disabled at an affiliation level based on client configuration.
