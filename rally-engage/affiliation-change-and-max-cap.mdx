### **Affiliation Change and Max Cap**

Affiliation Change details how shifts between affiliations (e.g., different plan types or groups) affect reward eligibility, earnings, and max cap balances, balancing continuity and adaptation.

#### **How it works**

- **Activity Carryover**: When a member moves between affiliations, their completed activities carry forward—they can’t re-earn rewards for the same activity in the new affiliation. Activities are tracked primarily by Activity ID, ensuring uniqueness. For choice reward types (e.g., financial missions), sub-activities are checked to prevent duplicate earnings under the same Activity ID. For instance, if a member completes a flu shot in Affiliation 2 and earns $50, switching to Affiliation 3 (where it’s worth 100%) doesn’t let them earn again for that flu shot activity.
- **Max Cap Balance with Same Currency**: If affiliations use the same currency (e.g., dollars), the member’s earned balance carries over, and they can earn up to the new affiliation’s max cap. For example, Affiliation 2 has a $200 cap, and a member earns $100 from two activities ($50 each). Moving to Affiliation 3 with a $300 cap, they start at $100 and can earn another $200. If Affiliation 2’s cap was $600 and they earned $400, moving to Affiliation 3’s $300 cap means they keep the $400 (no clawback), but can’t earn more. Returning to Affiliation 2, they’d resume at $400 and could earn up to $600 again ($200 more).
- **Max Cap Balance with Different Currencies**: If affiliations use different currencies (e.g., dollars in Affiliation 2, percentage in Affiliation 3), the balance resets to zero in the new affiliation, as prior earnings can’t be converted. Completed activities still don’t re-earn, but the member starts fresh toward the new cap. For example, earning $100 in Affiliation 2 and switching to Affiliation 3 (100% cap) resets them to 0%, allowing them to earn up to 100%. This can result in exceeding intended totals (e.g., $100 \+ 100%), a quirk of plan design.
- **Reward Timing Based on Award Date**: Rewards are determined by the affiliation at the time the activity is reported to the Capillary system (award date), not when it was completed (activity date). For instance, a member in Affiliation 2 (January 1st-31st) completes an annual physical on January 20th. If reported Feb 9th (after moving to Affiliation 3 on February 1st), they earn per Affiliation 3’s rules. If reported on January 25th (before moving to Affiliation 3), the member then earns as per Affiliation 2\.
