#### **Spotlight Campaigns**

The Spotlight section, prominently displayed at the top of the homepage, is a visually striking feature designed to capture attention and drive action. It builds on the legacy Spotlight campaigns from Rally but introduces a refreshed, modern design. Each campaign features a large, high-quality cover image that spans the section, paired with concise and impactful text: a short title and a brief description beneath it. For example, a Spotlight campaign promoting a new fitness challenge might feature a vibrant image of someone exercising, with the title "Step Up to Fitness" and a description like "Join our 30-day challenge to boost your health\!"

Tapping anywhere on the image directs the user to a preconfigured call-to-action (CTA). The supported CTAs are versatile and include:

- **External Links**: Simple hyperlinks to external websites, such as a partner’s wellness blog or a registration page for an event. Links to specific documents, such as PDFs / video can also be configured as external links within the system.
- **SSO Links**: Links to external systems configured with single sign-on (SSO), enabling seamless access to files or third-party tools. For example, an SSO link might connect to a health assessment tool hosted externally.
- **Internal Links**: These guide users to key sections of the platform, such as the Explorer page, Mission Space, Challenges page, Benefits page, Rewards tab, or even specific missions, challenges, or rewardable activities. For instance, a Spotlight campaign could link directly to a "Mindfulness Mission" within the Mission Space.

Spotlight campaigns are highly configurable. Rally can deploy them globally—such as for a feature launch announcement—or clients can target them at specific affiliations (e.g., employees of a particular department or organization). There’s no targeting beyond affiliation available at this time. Clients can customize the campaign by setting a start and end date, uploading a unique image, crafting the title and description, and defining the CTA. For example, a client might configure a campaign for their entire organization to promote a new benefits enrollment period, featuring a deadline of March 31, 2025, and linking to an external enrollment portal.
