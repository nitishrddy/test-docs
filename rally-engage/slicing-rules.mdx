### **Slicing Rules**

Slicing Rules ensure that rewardable activities are displayed and rewarded only to members who meet specific eligibility criteria, making activities relevant and reducing confusion.

#### **How They Work**

- **Eligibility-Based Display**: Activities are tailored to the appropriate audience using slicing rules based on factors like age, gender, or diagnosed conditions. Only members meeting these criteria see the activity in their “Rewardable Activities” list, and only they can earn rewards upon completion. For instance, an activity like “Get a breast cancer screening” wouldn’t appear for male members, as it’s irrelevant to them based on gender-based slicing rules.
- **Dynamic**: Slicing isn’t static; members can become eligible mid-plan year due to changes like aging into a new age bracket or receiving a new diagnosis. Once eligible, the activity appears in their list and remains visible until the plan year ends, even if they’ve earned all possible rewards. This persistence prevents confusion—members won’t wonder why an activity they saw earlier has disappeared. For example, a member turning 50 mid-year might suddenly see “Schedule a colonoscopy” appear, and it stays visible through December 31st.
- **Transparency Through Callouts**: Every activity with a slicing rule includes a conditional callout in the app, such as: “You’re eligible to earn for this activity only if you meet the below criteria,” followed by the specific conditions (e.g., “Female, age 40+”). This ensures members understand why they might not earn a reward. If a member completes an activity but doesn’t meet the criteria, they can refer to this callout on the rewardable activity page to see why no reward was issued, reducing surprise or frustration.
- **Persistence After Eligibility**: Once an activity is shown to a member, it doesn’t get hidden again during the plan year, even if they’ve earned the reward or can’t earn more. This design choice avoids scenarios where members call support, confused about missing activities they previously saw or completed. For example, if a member completes “Get a flu shot” and earns $50, the activity remains listed with a note like “Reward earned: $50,” so they don’t think it’s gone missing.

#### **Example**

Imagine a client offers “Get a mammogram” with a slicing rule: “Female, age 40+.” A 39-year-old female member won’t see this activity in her app until she turns 40\. On her 40th birthday, it appears in her “Rewardable Activities” list with the callout: “Eligible if female, age 40+.” She completes the mammogram and earns $75. The activity stays visible through the year, showing “Reward earned: $75,” so she isn’t alarmed by its presence. Meanwhile, a male member never sees this activity, ensuring relevance.
